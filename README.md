## HUGO installation

I use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) as my package manager or installation engine.

Installing HUGO is easy, I choose the extended version to allow for more capabilities.

```powershell
choco install hugo-extended -y
```

My build command

```bash
C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\hugo-extended\tools\hugo.exe
```

## Create a new post

I like to create my content based upon year  
My folder structure looks like this  

```bash
content  
|---post
    |---year
        |---postTitle
            |---index.md
```

```bash
hugo new post/{{year}}/{{postTitle}}/index.md
```
