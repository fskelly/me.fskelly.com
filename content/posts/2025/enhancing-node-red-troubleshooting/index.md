Do you have a lot of automation in your house using [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and are you looking for a way to increase the possibility of finding a faulty flow? If yes, follow me as I come up with a solution that might work for you as well.

This is a use case for me. Your mileage may vary.
This will take some time. 

> Anything worth doing is worth doing well.

## Background


So let me explain the problem and see if this sounds familiar. I use [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) **A LOT** along with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io). I made the decision a long time ago that the automations built into Home Assistant and the YAML engine was not for me. Please note that was quite a while, probably 5 or 6 years ago - the automation interface in  [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) is so much better now, *however* I am heavily invested in [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and will not be going back anytime soon.

## So what is the problem?

I have a lot of flows and nodes in my environment. I make heavy use of links and try to centralize as much as possible and use links (link in and link out) to ensure that the actions I perform are consistent. When you get to the size of my installation (over a 100 flows), troubleshooting and figuring out erratic or intermittent issues can be challenge. With all the wiring and multiple nodes and linking and multiple condition checking - it can become overwhelming to figure out where the problem starts and ends.

## How did I fix this?


I have spent time and this will be an on-going process to add GUIDs (yes, those long 32 digit things that are now everywhere) and simple use of a [subflow](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/subflows). The [subflow](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/subflows) I created is simply used right at the beginning of my flow and its **G**lobally **U**nique **ID**entifier now allows me to at least back-track to the start of the problematic flow and if the debug nodes returns more than 1 **GUID** that is also helpful.

So a simple enough change, but time-consuming to implement.

Here is the export of my subflow - feel free to use it.

```json

## Is it worth it?

Well, that depends on you and how much and effort you want to spend making your automation system resilient, robust and easy to troubleshoot.

For me, absolutely **YES**
