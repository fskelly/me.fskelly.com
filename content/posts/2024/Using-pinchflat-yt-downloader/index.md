# Using the Pinchflat YouTube Downloader

I am an avid listener of the [Self-Hosted Podcast](https://selfhosted.show/), and on a [recent episode](https://selfhosted.show/134), they mentioned a new tool called [Pinchflat](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat). Naturally, I decided to give it a try. I've already starred the repo, which is a great way to support the open-source community.

## Installation

There are specific [unRAID](https://unRAID.net/) [installation instructions](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat?tab=readme-ov-file#unRAID), and thanks to the great community around unRAID, the installation was a breeze.

Using unRAID, I was able to install Pinchflat via the Community App plugin. The tool is fairly intuitive and easy to use. I managed to download a few videos from YouTube without any issues. I'm the type of person who tries first and then reads the manual, so I didn't read the manual initially. Despite this, I was able to figure out how to use the tool without any problems.

## Usage

I follow several people and channels on YouTube and like to download their videos to watch later. This tool makes it easier to download videos and watch them at my convenience.

Currently, I'm consuming a [DevOps Master Class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nFr8RzQ4GIxUEznpNR53ERq) by John Savill. Pinchflat was one of the first items I added to my list, and it works as expected. Now, I can watch the videos offline using JellyFin. Please make a point of liking and subscribing to John's channel; he has some great content. Then, you can make the content available offline 😊.

## Conclusion

I am now using [Pinchflat](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat) to monitor many other YouTube users and channels. For me, this is a great way to have the content downloaded and ready for when I have time to watch it.

Happy downloading!
