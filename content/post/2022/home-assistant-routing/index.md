## Why do I need to change my routing?

I am a tinkerer by nature and I often need to move my Home Assistant instances around and by this, I mean create new instances and DEV versions. As complication of this, sometimes my UNIFI controller in not available and as such the following components are not available to me.

<!--more-->

1. DHCP
1. VLans
1. Full DNS
1. Routing between Vlans

As a geek, I do not allow this to deter me.

## The fix

The fix is quite easy if you understand your networking and you have access to the [Home Assistant Terminal](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh). This can also be achieved with a physical connection (keyboard and mouse) or an SSH session to the Home assistant Instance.I have a few vlans and ranges in my network and I need access to the following ranges. I have subnetted for smaller ranges.

1. 192.168.37.0/25 (CIDR 1)
1. 192.168.32.0/26 (CIDR 2)
1. 192.168.1.254 (Router)
1. Network card name (Supervisor enp0s25)

You will need to know the IP address of your router

```bash
nmcli connection show nmcli connection modify "Supervisor enp0s25" +ipv4.routes "192.168.37.0/25 192.168.1.254" nmcli connection modify "Supervisor enp0s25" +ipv4.routes "192.168.32.0/26 192.168.1.254"
```

This will take care of the Linux piece from Home Assistant. I have a Windows machine and my machine needs access to the same resources. I chose not to add these as persistent routes as usually the outage is limited and my Unifi and full functionality is usually restored quite quickly.

```bash
route ADD 192.168.37.0 mask 255.255.255.128 192.168.1.254 route ADD 192.168.32.0 mask 255.255.55.0
```

Until next time.
